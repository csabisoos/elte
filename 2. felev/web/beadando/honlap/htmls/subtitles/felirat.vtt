00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you probably know me already I'm famous

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the world over but do you know my story

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Brabant painted just as I remember it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that's where I grew up I was different

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
from the others

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
stubborn always in trouble at home and

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
at school things were better outdoors I

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
loved being out in the fields

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
do you know what you want to be yet well

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I certainly didn't I was an art dealer

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in Paris in London a teacher in England

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a priest in Belgium I tried the lot

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
nothing worked out

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
my brother Theo my best friend had an

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
idea Vincent you're good at drawing why

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
don't you do something with that well he

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was right I was always drawing and I

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
could learn how to paint there was no

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
time to lose

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
practice practice practice I was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
unstoppable

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Anton mouthed my cousin and a famous

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
artist taught me how to paint in oils I

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
got my first Commission drawing

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
cityscapes of the hague the train

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
station what a building all that glass I

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
wanted to show real-life nature the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
lives of farmers what I saw as I felt it

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that's what I wanted to paint something

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
good something with soul in it and look

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
there they are

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
they're weather-beaten faces in the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
shadows sitting in the light of a small

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
lamp poking their calloused hands into

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the dish of potatoes they themselves

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
have sown and harvested others didn't

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
think much of it

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
woman's nose looks like dice at the end

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of a pipe stem hmm even Theo thought it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
was too dark but I had started I was an

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
artist Theo I owe you so much when I

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
came to Paris I lived with you when I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
wanted to paint you paid for my paints

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and brushes and me I was insufferable

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
living only for my art late night

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
discussions with innovative artists like

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Lautrec burn our gogo about contrasts

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
colors loose brushstrokes but the work

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
wasn't selling

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I rarely had money for models so I'd

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
often end up looking in the mirror after

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
two years I was fed up with the city

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I headed south to the light the colors

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that's where I painted the colors of the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
wheat

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of the night

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and the see which have many more colors

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
than just blue

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
green purple blue pink the sea changes

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
color like a mackerel skin

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I looked around me and found beauty in

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
almost everything

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
even in these withering sunflowers

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I had big plans for this yellow house

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
where I wanted to work with others to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
create a new kind of art

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
but only my artist friend go gang came

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
South we had the most fierce discussions

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
about art what should you paint what you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
see with your eyes or what you see in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
your mind one evening things started to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
go wrong I just wasn't myself anymore I

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
cut off my left ear I was sick I had

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
myself admitted to hospital but I didn't

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
stop I worked on like some kind of

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
painting locomotive and slowly I got my

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
life back on track in the countryside

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
just north of Paris with Theo closeby I

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
worked incessantly my head was on fire

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
my paintbrush swept back and forth until

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
[Music]

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
now you know my story the story of a

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
misunderstood stubborn man who wouldn't

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
give up a story about needing to do what

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
it is that you're good at so tell me

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
what are you good at
